## Background Information

Bertrand, Marianne and Sendhil Mullainathan. 2004. "Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination." American Economic Review, 94 (4): 991â€“1013. Data cleaned and discussed in "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai.

"We study race in the labor market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U.S. labor market."


## Two Scenarios

* Imagine that you are a contemporary historian studying US employment in the year 2000 in Baltimore. You want to understand the process by which some people got jobs and some did not.

Population table: Units/rows are the individual ID per resume. It would have variables of black/white sounded name, gender, resume quality, 


## Data Generating Mechanism

```{r}
fit_call <- logistic_reg() |> 
    fit(call ~ gender + city + ethnicity + special + quality, data = x) 
```


```{r}
fit_call |> 
    tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
```

This is my data generating mechanism. 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}(\Pr(\text{call} = 1)) = 
& -2.66 
- 0.13 \cdot \text{gendermale} 
- 0.47 \cdot \text{citychicago} \\
& + 0.45 \cdot \text{ethnicitycauc} 
+ 0.81 \cdot \text{specialyes} 
- 0.16 \cdot \text{qualitylow}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

What are the questions you want to answer?

How can you use the **marginaleffects** package to answer them?

```{r}
predictions(fit_call, type = "prob")
# Add predictions and create a grouped bar plot
library(marginaleffects)
library(ggplot2)
predictions(fit_call,
            type = "prob",
            newdata = datagrid(
              ethnicity = unique(x$ethnicity),
              gender = unique(x$gender),
              quality = unique(x$quality),
              city = unique(x$city))
) |>
  mutate(prob_callback = 1 - estimate) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = prob_callback, fill = ethnicity)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +
  facet_grid(gender ~ city) +
 labs(
    title = "Probability of Receiving a Callback",
    subtitle = "White-sounding names and higher-quality resumes increase the chance of a callback",
    x = "Resume Quality",
    y = "Predicted Callback Probability",
    fill = "Ethnicity",
    caption = "Source: Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1),
    limits = c(0, 0.15)  # zooms in to highlight differences
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```
